**Healthcare Android Application**
A modern Android-based healthcare management application designed to simplify access to medical services such as doctor appointments, lab tests, medicine ordering, and health information — all in one platform.

**Introduction**
The rapid growth of mobile applications has enabled the digitization of essential services, including healthcare. This **Healthcare Android Application** aims to provide users with an easy and efficient way to access healthcare facilities digitally.

The app allows users to **register, book lab tests, find specialist doctors, schedule appointments, order medicines, and read health-related articles** through a single Android application. It is developed using **Kotlin** and follows modern Android development practices with **Firebase** integration and **MVVM architecture**.

 **Objectives**
- Design a **user-friendly and interactive UI** using XML and ConstraintLayout  
- Implement **secure login and registration** using Firebase Authentication  
- Store and manage healthcare data using **Cloud Firestore**  
- Follow **MVVM architecture** for clean, scalable, and maintainable code  
- Integrate core healthcare modules such as Doctors, Lab Tests, and Appointments  
- Ensure **real-time synchronization** and reliability  
- Perform testing and debugging for stable performance
  
 **Scope of the Project**
Included
- Digital healthcare management platform  
- Doctor search and appointment scheduling  
- Lab test booking and result viewing  
- Firebase-based authentication and data management  
- Modular Android app structure
